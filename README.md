# A Barebones custom MSE Player

This is a simple static MSE Player designed to play just a static MP4 video
There's not much here - just an example of how MSE alters the internal implementation
of the HTML5 video element and basically converting an MP4 to ArrayBuf format to sort of stream it

## Running the app
* Run `nvm use` and if you don't have the corresponding Node version - in most cases it should be fine, if not install the specific node version
* `npm i` will come next - obviously 
* `npm start` to see the app live

## Where to next
  * This is just an example to illustrate how MSE can be wired up, obviously there's a lot more that can be done and extended.
